                <h1>ORIGINS OF LIVING FELIDS</h1>
                <p>The origins of living felids, or the descendants of Pseudaelurus, were shrouded in
                    mystery for many years. A discovery in the Himilaya in 2010 gave scientists new insight into
                    some of the first modern “big cats”. These fossils were then described and named in 2014.<br>Panthera blytheae lived between 4.1 to 5.95 million years ago in the Tibetan plateau in
                    Pingwu, China. Scientists believe it resembled modern snow leopards in body and lifestyle. Only
                    a single fossil specimen of a Panthera blytheae cranium has been found. It is believed to be
                    about 10% smaller than the snow leopards. Although panthera blytheae isn’t the direct
                    ancestor of most living felids, the discovery of the species may confirm the origin of modern
                    species of the genus Panthera.<br>Panthera blytheae lived between 4.1 to 5.95 million years ago in the Tibetan plateau in

                    Americas during the Pleistocene epoch (2.5 mya – 10,000 years ago). It is not closely related to
                    modern tigers, but some scientists believe it was part of a group of extinct felines called
                    Machairodontinae (aka: Saber toothed cats). They are often called sabre-toothed tigers or
                    sabre-toothed lions. Smilodon are famous for their fearsome upper-canines. However, these
                    oversized teeth may have been just for show! Their teeth lacked protective covering of enamel,
                    which means they would have broken easily.<br>Recent research has shown evidence that smilodon was a forest-dweller who feasted on
                    smaller herbivores, ambushing them in closed forests rather than chasing them in more open
                    spaces. This suggests that smilodon had limited prey options, which could have sealed their fate
                    when its environment changed. The exact reason why smiloden died out is unknown, but this
                    research shows that it is likely due to extinction of its prey and climate change.</p>
